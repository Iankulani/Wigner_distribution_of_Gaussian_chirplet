# Wigner_distribution_of_Gaussian_chirplet
The Wigner Distribution is a time-frequency representation of a signal, and it's particularly useful in signal processing for analyzing non-stationary signals. The Gaussian Chirplet is a signal that combines both Gaussian and chirp properties (frequency modulation over time).
